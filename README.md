# Mountaineer

A World of Warcraft addon to support the Hardcore [Mountaineer Challenge](http://tinyurl.com/hc-mountaineers). Supports Classic Era, Season of Mastery, TBC, or WotLK.

This addon created by ManchegoMike ([Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ManchegoMike), [GitHub](https://github.com/ManchegoMike))

This addon cannot be "judge and jury" in every aspect of your Mountaineer Challenge, nor is it the final arbiter of what items are or aren't allowed. It doesn't *prevent* you from doing anything; it's simply a way to alert you to some obvious issues and keep you on the straight and narrow.

The one area where the addon *does* act as judge, jury, and executioner is in relation to your skill levels (unarmed, fishing, cooking, first aid). It will warn you if your skill levels are getting low, and if they drop far enough, it will tell you your run is over.

## Installation

You can do all of these steps *while the game is running*.

* Click the green `Code` button near the top of this page and select `Download ZIP`.
* When the ZIP file has finished downloading, find it on your computer & unzip it into your Interface\AddOns folder.
* The folder you just unzipped will most likely be named `Mountaineer-main`. Rename it to `Mountaineer`.
* Start WoW, or type `/reload` if it's already running.

## Features

* When your brand new level 1 character enters the game for the first time, all your gear is removed and placed into your backpack so you can sell it.

* Each time you login, your gear is checked to make sure you're not wearing anything you shouldn't.

* The primary way the addon determines if gear is allowed is by looking at how you got it. If you got it via looting, then it's fine. If you got it via quest or vendor, then it's only allowed if it's a recipe, a crafting reagent, or a miscellaneous weapon like a skinning knife, mining pick, or fishing pole. Otherwise it's a disallowed item. This is not an infallible method, but it seems to work. Even so, you can override the addonâ€™s determination in case it makes a mistake.

* Whenever you try to equip a disallowed item, you get a warning.

* Whenever you enter combat while wearing a disallowed item, you get a warning.

* Whenever you level up, your skills are checked to make sure you're on track. You'll get a warning if you're falling behind where you should be.

* Whenever you reach various points in your XP bar, your skills are to make sure you don't ding with a skill level so low it invalidates your run.

* Whenever you enter a resting area (city or inn), you'll see a message gently reminding you not to logout there.

* If you are a hunter and you cast [Revive Pet](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=982/revive-pet), you will get a reminder that you need to abandon your pet.

* None of the bonus challenges are supported by the addon at this time.

## Usage

You can use the console command `/mtn` or `/mountaineer`.

All of the following settings are global to your WoW account, so if you turn off sound or allow an item on character A, it will be the same for character B and *all* your characters.

Wherever you see `{id/name/link}`, you can specify by id# or name or link. To specify a link, type `/mtn allow` followed by a space, then SHIFT-click the actual item and it will paste the link into the text you're typing.

### /mtn version

Shows the current version of the addon.

### /mtn sound on/off

Turns addon sounds on or off.

### /mtn check

Checks your skills and currently equipped items for conformance.

### /mtn id {id/name/link}

Identifies an item. Prints some text to show some details about the item.<br/>Examples: `/mtn id 7005`, `/mtn id Skinning Knife`

### /mtn allow {id/name/link}

Allows you to equip/use an item.<br/>Examples: `/mtn allow 7005`, `/mtn allow Skinning Knife`

### /mtn disallow {id/name/link}

Disallows an item.<br/>Examples: `/mtn disallow 7005`, `/mtn disallow Skinning Knife`

### /mtn forget {id/name/link}

Forgets any allow-or-disallow designation for an item. This will force the item to be re-evaluated then next time you loot or buy it.<br/>Examples: `/mtn forget 7005`, `/mtn forget Skinning Knife`

### /mtn reset everything

Resets all allow-or-disallow designations to their "factory" settings. This will lose all your custom allows & disallows and cannot be undone, so use with caution.

## Limitations

- U.S. English is the only language supported. If you play in another language, the parsing won't work when you receive a new item.
- Bags are only checked (to see if you're allowed to use them) when you receive them, but not when you equip them.
- If you start using the addon with a character past level 1, it will assume everything you own is approved, unless you saw it previously on some other character and it was disapproved then.

## Wish list

- I'd like to include something in an item's mouse-hover text to indicate whether it's OK to use, but that would make this addon *significantly* more complex.
